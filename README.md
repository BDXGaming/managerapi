# ManagerAPI Pre Release
Exposing minecraft to a new level of connection

## Goals
- This plugin aims to allow for the connection of servers without the need of a proxy server or proxy system. (Note this plugin merely sends data between servers but does NOT replace the functionality of a proxy server such as bungeecord)
- It also enables other plugins to depend on ManagerAPI and utilize the collection of global data the plugin exposes without the use of a shared database system

## Note
This Plugin is still in early development and is prone to crashes/errors as a result.
